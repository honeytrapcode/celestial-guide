It is preferred if you come unaccompanied to respect the privacy of other clients.

#### Do's

* **Do** wash off any fake tan - affects tattoo absorption
* **Do** exfoliate up to a few days before - improves tattoo absorption
* **Do** eat well beforehand - prevents fainting
* **Do** get a good night's sleep - prevents fatigue and helps your experience

#### Don'ts

* **Don't** shave the area - we will do that properly at the studio
* **Don't** be hungover - alcohol thins blood and can affect tattooing
