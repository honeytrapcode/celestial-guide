It is preferred if you come unaccompanied to respect the privacy of other clients.

#### Do's

* **Do** wash off any fake tan - affects tattoo absorption
* **Do** exfoliate up to a few days before - improves tattoo absorption
* **Do** eat well beforehand - prevents fainting
* **Do** get a good night's sleep - prevents fatigue and helps your experience

#### Avoids

* **Avoid** shaving the area - if necessary we will do this at studio
* **Avoid** being hungover - alcohol thins blood and will affect tattoo absorption
