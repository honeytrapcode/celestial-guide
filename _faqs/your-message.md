If this is your first tattoo, or first with me, **Hi!**  
Thanks for getting here and I hope this little guide makes your tattoo journey easier.  
If I have tattooed you before I’d appreciate if you read the message below and feel free to browse the rest of the guide too :)

> *“Find what fits you, you don’t need to fit what you find”*

- It’s okay to have a feeling of nervousness, anxiety and excitement  
- I completely understand that coming into a new space is scary  
- You need to know that with me you are safe and secure  
- There is no judgement in this studio, my job is to put magic on your body.
