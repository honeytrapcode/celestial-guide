#### ☼ When You Arrive ☼

* We'll discuss your design based on your enquiry form
* We'll work together to make any adjustments until it's exactly what you want
* This consultation time is included in your appointment slot
* We'll try different sizes and placements until you're 100% satisfied
* Only when you're completely happy will we begin tattooing

#### ☽ During The Session ☽

It's perfectly normal to feel anxious or overstimulated during your session. To make your experience comfortable:

* It's okay to wear your headphones
* It's absolutely fine to take breaks to rest or eat ✨
* Silence is okay - you don't have to talk
* Reading a book is welcome
* Chatting is also welcome if you prefer!

#### ✨ Conversation Topics I Enjoy ✨
* Nature
* Art
* Walking
* Reading
* Wine ☽
* Or tell me about your interests!

#### ☼ Numbing Options ☼

If you want to use numbing cream during your appointment, that's fine, but you must:
* Source this yourself
* Apply it approximately one hour before the appointment
