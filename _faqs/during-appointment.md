**When You Arrive**

Upon arrival we will talk about your design, I will have a sketch based on your enquiry form.
Together we can communicate about the design at your appointment until is exactly as you want it.
I find this method more useful as, in person, we can speak about it how you want it to look.

If I send you a design and you want adjustments that’s more difficult to make changes compared to a small consultation upon arrival.
This conversation length is factored into the time slot allotted. 

After this we will discuss sizes, you can show me approximately the size but I will print it out a few times so you can compare and choose the best size. 
We can try on as many sizes as you’d like until you are completely comfortable with the way the stencil looks on your skin.
It is fine to try different placements even at this stage of the journey.

Once you are 100% happy we will start tattooing.

**During The Session**

It is okay to wear your headphones.
It’s absolutely fine to have a break to rest, eat food.
It’s completely normal for you to feel anxious or overstimulated. 
Please let me know if you feel this way and
Silence is okay
Headphones are okay
Reading a book 
However chatting is welcome too!

Here’s things I love to talk about:
Nature
Art
Walking
Reading
Wine
Etc.

Or tell me something you’re interested in that’s great too.

If you want to use numbing cream during your appointment that is fine but you must source this yourself as it needs to be applied an hour before the appointment.
